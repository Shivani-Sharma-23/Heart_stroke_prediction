**Heart Stroke Prediction Model**

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting the risk of heart strokes in individuals based on a set of medical and demographic features. Early detection and prevention of heart strokes can save lives, and this model aims to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in assessing stroke risk.

## Features

- High-accuracy prediction model.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques.
- Jupyter notebooks with detailed data analysis and model training.
- Python code for deploying the model.

## Data

The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset containing anonymized patient information, including medical history, lifestyle, and genetic factors. Data sources are cited within the repository.

## Usage

You can use our model to predict the risk of a heart stroke by following the instructions provided in our Jupyter notebooks. Additionally, we offer a simple API for predictions.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.6+
- NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and other libraries (see `requirements.txt` for details).
